    <p>SMaHT is an NIH initiative to identify non-inherited, somatic variations in human genomes and understand the role of such genetic variation in human health, development, aging, and disease. Please refer to our <a href="https://data.smaht.org/about/consortium/data" target="_blank">data overview</a> to see the data types that the SMaHT Network generates. For more information about the Network, please visit the <a href="https://www.smaht.org" target="_blank">SMaHT Organization Center website</a>.</p>

    <p>The Network consists of: <span className="center-count color-tpc">1 TPC</span> (Tissue Procurement Center); <span className="center-count color-gcc">5 GCCs</span> (Genome Characterization Centers) that generate sequencing data; <span className="center-count color-dac">1 DAC</span> (Data Analysis Center), and <span className="center-count color-ttd">14 TTDs</span> (Tools and Technology Development) projects that focus on developing novel experimental and computational methods to detect somatic mosaic mutations.</p>
