    <p>The SMaHT (Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues) Network is a new NIH initiative to identify non-inherited, somatic variations in human genomes over time and to understand the role of such genetic variation in human health, development, aging, and disease.</p>

    <p>The Network consists of:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A Tissue Procurement Center that procures tissue samples from post-mortem donors</li>
        <li>Five Genome Characterization Centers that generate sequencing data</li>
        <li>A Data Analysis Center that uniformly processes the SMaHT data</li>
        <li>14 Tools and Technology Development Projects what focus on developing novel experimental assays and computational methods to detect somatic mutations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The SMaHT Network aims to generate sequencing data using multiple short- and long-read technologies and profiling assays. Please refer to our <a href="/about/consortium/data">data overview</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>The location and more information about the SMaHT Network members are below.</p>
