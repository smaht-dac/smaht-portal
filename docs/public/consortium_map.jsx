    <p>SMaHT is an NIH initiative to identify non-inherited, somatic variations in human genomes and understand the role of such genetic variation in human health, development, aging, and disease.</p>

    <p>Please refer to our <a href="https://data.smaht.org/about/consortium/data" target="_blank">data overview</a> to see the data types that the SMaHT Network generates. For more information about the Network, please visit the <a href="https://www.smaht.org" target="_blank">SMaHT Organization Center website</a>.</p>

    <p>The Network consists of: (1) Tissue Procurement Center (TPC); (2) Genome Characterization Centers (GCCs) that generate sequencing data; (3) Data Analysis Center (DAC), and (4) Tools and Technology Development (TTD) projects that focus on developing novel experimental and computational methods to detect somatic mosaic mutations.</p>
