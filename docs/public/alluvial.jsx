    <h3>COLO829</h3>
    <p>COLO829 (COLO829T) is a metastatic melanoma cancer cell line, which has a matched normal lymphoblast cell line, COLO892BL, derived from the same individual. For benchmarking analysis, COLO829T cells were mixed with COLO829BL cells at a mixture ratio of 1:50 (COLO829BLT50)‚Äù.</p>

    <h3>Benchmarking study using the HapMap Cell Line Mixture</h3>
    <p>For benchmarking analysis, two HapMap mixtures were created as the following:</p>
    <p>Mixture 1 with six HapMap cell lines</p>
    <ul>
        <li>10% HG02622 (F, AFR)</li>
        <li>2% for each HG002 (M, EUR/ASH JEW), HG02257 (F, AFR), and HG02486 (M, AFR)</li>
        <li>0.5% HG00438 (F, EAS)</li>
        <li>83.5% HG005 (M, CHB)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mixture 2 with three HapMap cell lines</p>
    <ul>
        <li>93% HG001 (F, EUR)</li>
        <li>2% HG002 (M, EUR/ASH JEW)</li>
        <li>5% HG005 (M, CHB)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Benchmarking study using iPSCs / Fibroblasts</h3>
    Five induced pluripotent stem cell lines were derived from distinct skin fibroblast cell lines from five adults. 

    <h3>Benchmarking study using primary tissues</h3>
    Primary tissues were obtained from post-mortem donors.
