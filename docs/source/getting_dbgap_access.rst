The SMaHT datasets were generated as part of the NIH Common Fund consortium initiative, Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT).

The SMaHT datasets are submitted under dbGaP studies (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap), with the study accession numbers, **phs004193** for the SMaHT Benchmarking data, and **phs004194** for the SMaHT Production data. The datasets were provided by the SMaHT Data Analysis Center (DAC) [1UM1DA058230] on behalf of the SMaHT Network.

We are in the process of releasing the SMaHT studies on dbGaP. Instructions on how to get protected data permission from dbGaP are coming soon.
