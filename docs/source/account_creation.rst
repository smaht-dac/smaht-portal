Account Creation
================


* Please email data wranglers at `smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net <mailto:smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net>`_ to get set up with an account with the access credentials for your role.
* Please provide an email address which you wish to use for your account and CC your PI for validation purposes. **The email associated with the account you use for login must be the same as the one registered with the SMaHT OC.**

  * This can be any email address (\ *e.g. an institutional email account*\ ) but must be connected to a Google account.
  * For more information on linking your institutional email account to a Google account, see below.


Signing in with your institutional email address
------------------------------------------------
* The DAC uses the `OAuth <https://oauth.net/>`_ authentication system which will allow you to login with a Google account.
* If you prefer to use your institutional email address to log in to the portal (recommended), you need to have a Google account registered with that email address.
* If you do not already have a Google account with your email address, you can set up one up by visiting the `Google account creation page with the non-gmail option <https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail>`_.

Note that it is important not to register this Google account with your Gmail address as your institutional email address. Instead, register with your institutional email address as the primary email associate with the Google account in order for authentication to work properly!

Once your account request is processed, you will then be able to log in with the 'LOG IN WITH GOOGLE' option using your institutional email address and Google account password.
