How to Create a Data Portal Account
===================================

.. IMPORTANT::
    Please read the entire document before creating your Google account!

.. NOTE::
    Currently, the data access is granted to the Network members with an account to the data portal.

|


Step 1: (for SMaHT Network Members) Get Registered with SMaHT OC
----------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, portal access is granted only to SMaHT network members registered and verified by the Network Organization Center (OC). Please email the OC at `smahtsupport@gowustl.onmicrosoft.com <mailto:smahtsupport@gowustl.onmicrosoft.com>`_ to be registered. Please CC your PI in this e-mail for the verification process.

To complete registration, Network members should provide **their institutional email address** in the SMaHT Network Directory from the OC, which you need to use to log into the SMaHT Data Portal. In order to be verified, users need to put complete information in the SMaHT Network Directory.



Step 2: Ask SMaHT DAC to set up your portal account
---------------------------------------------------

Please email DAC Data Wranglers at `smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net <mailto:smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net>`_ to have a portal account created.

*	When you contact DAC, provide your full name and institutional email address in the SMaHT Network Directory (*very important!*).
*	Also, indicate the name of your PI and institution and whether or not you have been verified by OC.

We will notify you once you are in our database. In the meantime, you can move on to Step 3.



Step 3: Create a Google Account using Your Institutional Email
--------------------------------------------------------------

The DAC uses the `OAuth authentication system <https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2>`_ which will allow you to login using a Google account linked to your institutional email address in the SMaHT Network Directory. To use your institutional email address to log into the portal, you will need a Google Account registered with that email address.

.. NOTE::
    You will create and USE A GOOGLE ACCOUNT, NOT A GMAIL ACCOUNT. Learn more about setting up Google Accounts `here <https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722060?hl=en>`_.

|

To create the Google Account linked to your institutional email (not your Gmail!), you can set it up by visiting the `Google account creation page <https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail>`_ with the non-gmail option. Register this account with your institutional email address.


.. TIP::
    Do not use your Gmail email address for this purpose. You will not be able to log in if your personal Gmail is linked to the Google Account.


Step 4: Sign In with Your Google Account
----------------------------------------

Once your account request to DAC is processed (Step 2), you will be able to log into the SMaHT portal via the “Sign in with Google” option and your Google account.

If you are already logged into this account elsewhere on your computer, you may be able to simply select the account on the “Choose an account” popup. Otherwise, you will need to sign in with your institutional email and Google account password.

FAQ and Troublsehooting
=======================


**I already have a Google account set up with my institutional email address used for other data portals (e.g. 4DN). Can I sign into the SMaHT Portal using that Google account?**

Yes, as long as the institutional email you provided to SMaHT OC and DAC is the primary email address on the account, this should work without any issues.

|

**I tried to create a Google account, but it said “That username is taken. Try another.” What should I do?**

Looks like your institutional email is already used as the primary email on a different Google Account. You should be able to recover the account by going to the Google Accounts password change page. There, enter your institutional email, and Google will send a recovery email to the email address on file.

|

**I tried to log in with my Google account, but the portal says: “Account Unauthorized: An account associated with the email address does not exist in the system.” What should I do?**

This means that SMaHT DAC hasn’t finished setting up your account. If you have not requested access yet, please return to Step 2 above. You can also click the “Help Desk” button on the top right corner of the SMaHT data portal homepage (`https://data.smaht.org <https://data.smaht.org>`_) or the “Request Access” button in the “Account Unauthorized” popup to start an email request to DAC in your computer’s default email client.

|

**I tried to log in with my Google account, but the portal says: “Something went wrong.” What should I do?**

This sounds like a technical error on our end. Please submit a bug report to `smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net <mailto:smhelp@hms-dbmi.atlassian.net>`_ and include information about the operating system and web browser you are using. Also include the email address that you used to sign in.
