============
SMaHT Portal
============


This repository serves as SMaHT Portal for the Data Analysis Center. It is an ENCODED
style system modeled after previous iterations (fourfront, cgap-portal) previously
developed by the Park Lab. In this iteration, the majority of code in this repository is
UI, data model and DevOps related. Core data models common to our projects can be found
in the ``encoded-core`` repository, while core back-end features can be found in our
``snovault`` repository.
