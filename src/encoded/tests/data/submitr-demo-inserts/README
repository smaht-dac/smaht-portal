OVERVIEW
--------
This files are suitable (at least as of circa February 2025) for import into a locally running smaht-portal for
some basic testing of smaht-submitr, per this demo script: https://github.com/smaht-dac/submitr/blob/master/demo.sh
Getting smaht-portal up/running locally is beyond the scope of this README file.

LOADING THESE FILES INTO SMAHT-PORTAL
-------------------------------------
Here is one way to load these files into smaht-portal, after it is up/running (i.e. make deploy1/deploy2);
this make use of a script (hms-portal-update) available in the dmichaels-utils library/package.

  pip install dmichaels-utils
  hms-portal-update --ini development.ini --load src/encoded/tests/data/submitr-demo-inserts --verbose

Your IDENTITY environment variable must be appropriately set (e.g. export IDENTITY=C4AppConfigSmahtWolf),
and your current AWS credentials should be referring to the appropriate account (e.g. smaht-wolf/537626822796), 
i.e. the same one used for running smaht-portal (i.e. via make deploy1/deploy2).  

GENERATING THESE FILES
----------------------
Here is one way (via bash) to generate these files in the first place, exporting (say) from
staging (i.e. staging.smaht.org) to local files suitable for import (via above mechanism); this
makes use of a script (hms-portal-read) in the dmichaels-utils package referenced/installed above.

  ENV=smaht-data
  COUNT=1000
  OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/your_output_directory
  TYPES=(assays donors file-formats preparation-kits quality-metrics sequencers sequencing software submission-centers users)
  for TYPE in "${TYPES[@]}"; do
      hms-portal-read --env ${ENV} "/${TYPE}?limit=${COUNT}" --inserts --verbose --output ${OUTPUT_DIR}
  done

The ENV variable (e.g. smaht-data) is the local name of the AWS environment from whic you wish to export data.
