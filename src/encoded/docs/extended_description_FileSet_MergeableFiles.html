<p>The Mergeable Files grouping can help guide whether certain files within file sets are candidates for merging. Submitted by data can always be searched on, but if additional facets for sample source, sequencing and assay are available, this indicates there are file sets that contain files that could potentially be merged with others. File sets that match values across all 4 fields: Submitted By, Sample Source Tag, Sequencing Tag and Assay Tag are candidates for merge. </p>
