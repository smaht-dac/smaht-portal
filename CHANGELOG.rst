* 2025-02-05 / dmichaels
  - Branch: dmichaels-20250130-release-tracker-api-add-submitted-file | PR-337
    - Derived from branch: main (commit: 8616c891bb93001d756f5a7eb6cbe0910d74780c)
    - With merged in branch: sn_dsa_embed -> NEVERMIND -> BACKED OUT THIS MERGE FOR THIS BRANCH
  - Added support for additional SubmittedFile type to release tracker API i.e. /recent_released_files.
    This requires that the new File.override_release_tracker_description property be populated for affected types;
    the calculated property release_tracker_description will depend on this (TODO: how is that populated).
  - Added support for qc_values "psuedo-columns" for smaht-submitr; and also for multiple sheets of same type.
    This is by virtue of using dcicutils.submitr.custom_excel.CustomExcel in ingestion_processor.py.
  - In ingestion/submission_folio.py no longer assume consortia comes through from submitr;
    this was causing problems for non-admin users; but actually changed it back to let it come through;
    went back/forth on this; in the end removed restricted_fields designation for consortia in mixins.json.
  - In ingestion/load_extensions.py use  noset_last_modified=True for loadxl call;
    this was causing problems for non-admin users; requires dcicsnovault 11.24.0+.
  - Updated the smaht-submitr spreadsheet template version;

=======

* 2024-11-20/dmichaels - branch: dmichaels-20241119-browse-view (PR-295)

* Added module browse.py for /browse; adapted from fourfront/.../search.py/browse.
  This is for ticket: https://hms-dbmi.atlassian.net/browse/C4-1184

* New endpoint /recent_files_summary which, by default, returns info for files released
  within the past three months grouped by release-date, cell-line or donor, and
  file-description. The specific fields used for these groupings are:

  - release-date: file_status_tracking.released
  - cell-line: file_sets.libraries.analytes.samples.sample_sources.cell_line.code
  - donor: donors.display_title
  - file-dsecription: release_tracker_description

  Note that release_tracker_description is a newer (2024-12) calcprop (PR-298/sn_file_release_tracker);
  and included in this branch are these files from the branch sn_file_release_tracker:

  - src/encoded/item_utils/file.py
  - src/encoded/types/file.py

  Added these new modules to support this new endpoint:

  - src/encoded/endpoints/recent_files_summary/recent_files_summary.py
  - src/encoded/endpoints/recent_files_summary/recent_files_summary_fields.py
  - src/encoded/endpoints/recent_files_summary/recent_files_summary_troubleshooting.py (functionally unnecessary)
  - src/encoded/endpoints/elasticsearch_utils.py (maybe move to dcicutils eventually)
  - src/encoded/endpoints/endpoint_utils.py (maybe move to dcicutils eventually)

  This is for ticket: https://hms-dbmi.atlassian.net/browse/C4-1192

`PR 240: fix: SN TPC samples annotated_filenames <https://github.com/smaht-dac/smaht-portal/pull/240>`_

* In `commands/create_annotated_filename.py`:

  * Grab unique `aliquot_ids` so that files with tissue samples from TPC are not considered to have merged aliquots e.g. file has identical samples `ST001-1A-001A1` from GCC and `ST001-1A-001A1` from TPC. The TPC item is used for metadata cross-checking, and shouldn't be considered when checking if samples were merged for analyte extraction.

* 2024-03-14: This is a temporary branch (extra_files_plus_main_20240314)
  which is Will's extra_files branch with main merged in (2024-03-14), and
  also Utku's utk_es_max_hit branch (PR-114) with documentation changes merge in.
  FYI: Branch utk_es_max_hit was merged into main 2024-03-19.
* Added missing import of calculated_property from snovault to types/submitted_file.py.
* Documentation changes.

* Changes to support "resuming" smaht-submitr submission after a server
  validation "submission" timed out while waiting (via submit-metadata-bundle).

  In this (server validation timeout) case the user can then run check-submission with
  the UUID for the validation submission, and if/when it is complete and successful,
  the user will be allowed to continue on to do the actual submission. Slightly tricky
  because the metadata file was uploaded (to S3) as a part of the validation submission,
  and/but when check-submission is run we don't want the user to have to specify this
  file again, partly because it is an odd user experience, but mostly because when we
  do the actual submission we want to make sure we use the EXACT file that was validated;
  and so to do this we grab the file from where it was uploaded as part of the validation
  submission (i.e. under an S3 key with the validation UUID) and copy it over to where
  it would normally be (i.e. under an S3 key with the submission UUID); and from there
  things continue as normal. Note also that both of the IngestionSubmission objects have
  a pointer to the other; i.e. the validation submission object has "submission_uuid"
  and the actual submission object has a "validation_uuid" (in the "parameters");
  this hookup is done by the smaht-submitr code.

  The "resuming" scare-quotes are because this is not really resuming a submission but
  rather resuming the process the submit-metadata-bundle was doing, i.e. where it does
  a server validation then then, if successful and okay with the user, it continues on
  to do the actual submission. The "submission" scare-quotes for the server validation
  is because this is a submission in the sense that an IngestionSubmission object is
  created, but not an actual submission because it is a validate_only submission.

* Added display_title calculated property to IngestionSubmission to display either
  Validation or Submission depending on validate_only (followed by colon and uuid).
